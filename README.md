## Welcome to GitHub Pages of HKUST BIM LAB

We are a research team from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) working on Building Information Modeling (BIM) and construction information technology (IT), led by [Prof. Jack C.P. Cheng](https://facultyprofiles.ust.hk/profiles.php?profile=jack-chin-pang-cheng-cejcheng), currently an Associate Professor of HKUST. Here is our GitHub profile [[click](https://github.com/hkustbimlab)]. 


## Goal
This page aims to share latest studies and datasets published by HKUST BIM LAB. You can directly download our public datasets for your research. We also select some of our published papers and provide the PDF files here. Hope our resources can help your research.

## Resources
Following is a list of our public resources. (**More resources will be ready soon.**)
